# Chess Game :crown:

## The Project:
This project was developed together in this [complete java course](https://www.udemy.com/course/java-curso-completo/) with the prof. [Nelio](https://www.udemy.com/user/nelio-alves/).

It consists in a Java application build in layers.
Basically, we have define all the rules of movements for each piece. When the player select a piece, the board will show all the possible moves the player can do.
(The code is also properly commented as a good pratice of programming).
